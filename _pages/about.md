Hi, I'm Hamza.

I'm a final-year mathematics student at Hofstra University. I'm broadly interested in using rigorous mathematics to model, understand, and predict behavior in complex, strategic, and uncertain environments. My research explores the theoretical foundations of decision-making, sitting at the intersection of algorithmic game theory, optimization, and stochastic processes.

At Hofstra, I've had the fortunate opportunity to conduct research with faculty members in the Department of Mathematics. I am actively applying to PhD programs for Fall 2026 and am excited to find a new research home.

Research interests:

- Algorithmic Game Theory & Computational Social Science
- Stochastic Processes & Mathematical Finance
- Optimization Theory
- Machine Learning Theory & Statistical Inference
- Microeconomic Theory & Industrial Organization
- Number Theory & Combinatorics

Feel free to reach out via email for collaboration or questions.

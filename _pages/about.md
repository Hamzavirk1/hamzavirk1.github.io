I'm Hamza Virk, an undergraduate researcher interested in high-energy particle physics and computational methods. My current work focuses on data analysis techniques and simulation workflows used in modern collider experiments. I'm especially excited about bridging theoretical models with experimental datasets to extract robust, reproducible insights.

Research interests:

* Particle physics phenomenology
* Scientific computing & data pipelines
* Detector simulation and reconstruction algorithms
* Statistical inference & uncertainty quantification

Outside of research, I enjoy mentoring peers, exploring open-source tools, and learning about visualization techniques for complex physical systems.

Feel free to reach out via email for collaboration or questions.
